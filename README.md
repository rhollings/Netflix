# Netflix Clone
Here I have recreated the main page of Netflix using ReactJs 

The page is depolyed using Firebase

API used comes from <a href="https://developer.imdb.com/">IMDB</a> website

Noticable Features added were
- horizontal scrolling 
- banner movie w/ title and description
- media sorted by categories
