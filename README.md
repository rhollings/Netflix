# Netflix Clone
This application (a Netflix clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Styled Components. I used compound components (just a design pattern) to build my components, and there's over 10 examples as to how these are used. The styling is all handled via styled components. Using compound components made my actual components really easy to test.

!!! Works better in Safari (Chrome updates made higher restrictions)

Noticable Features added were
- horizontal scrolling 
- banner movie w/ title and description
- media sorted by categories
